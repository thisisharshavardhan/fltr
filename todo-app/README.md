# To-Do List Application

This is a minimal to-do list application built using Node.js and Express.js. The application is structured into two main parts: the backend and the frontend.

## Project Structure

```
todo-app
├── backend
│   ├── server.js        # Entry point for the backend application
│   ├── package.json     # Configuration file for npm
│   └── README.md        # Documentation for the backend
├── frontend
│   ├── index.html       # Main HTML file for the frontend
│   └── app.js           # JavaScript code for the frontend
└── README.md            # Documentation for the entire project
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
